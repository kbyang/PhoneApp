Levels: <br>
1. Press button (maybe enter name, and we'll cross reference with your google account)<br>
"Good, you passed level 1!"<br>

4. Decline ex's call: Drag the red button through a maze<br>
5. Send a drunk text: Scramble up their keyboard or do something to make it hard for them to text and give them a sentence or phrase to text<br>

7. Get it in: Put the right blocks in the right holes<br>
8. Get phone number: Type in a phone number. We'll warn you that we're going to text that person though! And it can't be a fake number.<br>
